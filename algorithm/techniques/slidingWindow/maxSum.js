/**
 * 
 * Sliding Window Shrinkable
 * What is the sliding window technique?

   As its name suggests, this technique involves taking a subset of data from a given array or string,
   expanding or shrinking that subset to satisfy certain conditions, hence the sliding effect.
 * 
   Scenario 1: 
 * Sliding Window Technique: The technique can be best understood with the window pane in the bus,
 *  considering a window of length n and the pane which is fixed in it of length k.
 *  Consider, initially the pane is at extreme left i.e., at 0 units from the left. 
 *  Now, co-relate the window with array arr[] of size n and pane with current_sum of size k elements. Now, 
 *  if we apply force on the window, it moves a unit distance ahead. 
 *  The pane will cover the next k consecutive elements. 
 * 

Applying the sliding window technique : 
    1 .We compute the sum of the first k elements out of n terms using a linear loop and store the sum in variable window_sum.
    2. Then we will graze linearly over the array till it reaches the end and simultaneously keep track of the maximum sum.
    3.To get the current sum of a block of k elements just subtract the first element from the previous block and add the last element of the current block.

The below representation will make it clear how the window slides over the array.

/**

 * let array = [5,2,-1,0,3]
 * let size = array.length
 * let k = 4 // suggested number
 * 
 *  // find intial sum of the first k element
 *  
 *   let sum = 5 + 2 + (-1) + 0
 *   let max = sum
 * 
 *   after getting the first sum of k
 *   then run a loop where i is the index of k
 *   and sum is calculated where i is 4 here
 *   sum = sum + array[i] - array[i- k]   i.e sum = 6 + array[4] - array[4 - 4]
 *   
 *   run a comparison to check if the current sum is greater than the max
 *   
 *   if(max > sum)  max = max
 *   else max = sum
 *   return max
